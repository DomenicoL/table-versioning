# PostgreSQL Bitemporal Solution

Welcome to the repository for the PostgreSQL bitemporal solution.

This solution provides two schemas for managing bitemporal data:
- **`common`**: Contains the core functions and data types.
- **`vrsn`**: Contains the specific logic for versioning and managing bitemporal tables.

Installation and upgrades are managed through scripts, which allow you to customize schema names and track changes.
